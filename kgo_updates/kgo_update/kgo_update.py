This script will parse the rose-ana-comparisons.db produced by a valid
rose-stem suite, writing and executing a sub-script which performs a
KGO update (creating new KGO folders and installing the required files)

This script will no longer ask questions of the user and instead expects to be
passed arguments as command line arguments. The suite expects as minimum:
    python3 kgo_update.py -S <suite_name> -U <suite_user> -N <new_kgo_dir>

Required Command Line Arguments:
=> -S The name of the suite with the new kgo
=> -U The username of the owner of the above suite

Optional Arguments:
=> --new-kgo-dir -N  Give the name of the new kgo dir. If not specified then the
                     suite will install kgo to the directory kgois currently
                     found in.
=> --non-interactive Run in non-interactive mode. The suite will not ask any
                     questions. This is not a recommended option
=> --new-release     Only for use by the Systems Team when releasing a new
                     version of the UM
=> -P Specify the platform this is being run on. Currently only relevant if the
      site is meto - if so then it will be automatically populated if not given
=> -E --extension    Specify the extension of the variables file. .rc or .cylc
