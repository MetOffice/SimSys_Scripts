"""
Scan a users (inteded as frzz for nightly testing) cylc-run directory for
cylc8 suites with uncompleted tasks
Restart each found and retrigger failed/submit-failed tasks
Can pass names of suites as positional arguments.
Doesn't need to be entire name, eg. passing lfric_apps will retrigger any suite
with lfric_apps in the name
