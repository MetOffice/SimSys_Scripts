# SimSys Scripts

This repository contains support scripts that are common across the many
simulation and modelling codes owned by the Met Office. Particularly those
owned and maintained by the SSD team.

Also contains a copy of script_updater.sh which is intended to live in the fcm
repositories to pull from this repository.
