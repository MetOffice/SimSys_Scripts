# SimSys Scripts

This repository contains support scripts that are common across the many simulation and modelling codes owned by the Met Office.
Particularily those owned and maintained by the SSD team.

Also contains a copy of script_updater.sh which is intended to live in the fcm repositories to pull from
this repo.
