This repository contains support scripts that are common across the many
simulation and modelling codes owned by the Met Office. Particularly those
owned and maintained by the Simulation Systems and Deployment (SSD) team.

Also contains a copy of `script_updater.sh` which is intended to live in the
fcm repositories to pull from this repository.
