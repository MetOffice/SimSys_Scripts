"""
Rose-stem test for checking the branch working copy with the trunk.

Fail if any files are changed by the umdp3_checker.py script.

Return a list of any files changed by the umdp3_checker.py script.

Usage:
 Fortran files must end in .f90, .F90 or .inc extension.
 Copy files to work/tmp.
 Run the script on the whole tmp dir.
 Diff with the working copy.
 Fail if changes and return files that need changing.
