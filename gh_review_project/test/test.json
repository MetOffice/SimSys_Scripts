It reads a netcdf file containing a set of field timeseries, and regrids them into a destination mesh. At the moment the destination mesh is the full regional mesh, and in the output we have lbc values at the rim of the domain, and zeroes in the inside.\r\n\r\nI had to create a dedicated clock for OASIS instead of using the modeldb clock, given that now we are reading a time series and we can not change the time at will. The source of data used to create lbcs is copied locally, so it will have to be copied to a central location. I could not link the clock ticking to file advance because this seems to work only for a single XIOS context, but we have two.\r\n\r\nOne of the existing KGOs had to be updated. The reason is that the KGO test was using the wrong mesh, and this error was introduced in ticket 621: https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/lfric_apps/ticket/621\r\n\r\n- closes #48 \r\n- fixes #48 \r\n\r\n## Code Quality Checklist\r\n\r\n(_Some checks are automatically carried out via the CI pipeline_)\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My code follows the project's style guidelines\r\n      [style guidelines](https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_core/how_to_contribute/index.html#how-to-contribute-index)\r\n- [x] Comments have been included that aid undertanding and enhance the\r\n      readability of the code\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested this change locally, using the LFRic Apps rose-stem suite\r\n- [x] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and\r\n      acceptable (eg. kgo changes)\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (eg. system\r\n      tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n- [x] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource\r\n      and have tests been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the\r\n      developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource\r\n      and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n\r\n# Test Suite Results - lfric_apps

FCM Trac ticket: [Apps:900](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/lfric_apps/ticket/900)\r\nLinked planned Documentation update: #25 \r\nPlanned follow up tech debt ticket: #86\r\n\r\n<!-- To be completed by the developer -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a brief description of the changes in this PR, including any notes\r\n     useful for reviewers -->\r\nThe primary goal of this ticket is to lift aspects like the options list, which was common across scripts, but initialised for a particular script, and collate this to allow the creation of a global script.\r\nAll of the newer scripts were often using copies of identical code.\r\nThis ticket creates a bucket script which is read in, and given a specific file name, the bespoke sections, originally across multiple scripts, are utilised by a single file. \r\nIt also mandates in the make system that if we want to use PSyclone on a file, without a script, it needs to be explicitly stated, otherwise the global script is used. \r\nTo ensure this rigidity, the no script line is moved to a script which is only called if the user specifies the file needs a PSyclone pass without a file. \r\nTo accommodate this change, and ensure other sites are not adversely affected, I've done a bit of housekeeping other the sites directories, adding dummy global scripts where required, or sym-linking whole directories like Transmute's PSyKal cousin.

of the code\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested this change locally, using the LFRic Apps rose-stem suite\r\n- [x] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and\r\n      acceptable (eg. kgo changes)\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (eg. system\r\n      tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n- [x] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource\r\n      and have tests been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the\r\n      developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource\r\n      and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n<!-- Paste your trac.log from

changes in this PR, including any notes\r\n     useful for reviewers -->\r\nDue to the size and complexity of boundry layer, this ticket is a sub-section of 'easy-win' files. \r\nWe are aiming to utilise PSyclone for all of optimisation in LFRic. \r\nThese files contain quite simple structures and loops, a local script has been created for most of the times. \r\n* It removes any non performant j loops. \r\n* spans a file wide parallel section\r\n* Adds OMP Dos inside\r\n* Not all files in this opt use this local script\r\n* Small bespoke needs per file which use the local script have been

rose-stem suite\r\n- [x] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and\r\n      acceptable (eg. kgo changes)\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (eg. system\r\n      tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n- [ ] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource\r\n      and have tests been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the\r\n      developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource\r\n      and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable)

new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource\r\n      and have tests been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the\r\n      developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource\r\n      and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n\r\n# Test Suite Results -

I am in the process of porting the changes from my mosrs branch to Github.** \r\n\r\nThis pull request summarises changes to the INFERNO fire module made in order to couple it with the WHAM model of human fire use and management. This improves INFERNO's performance significantly. \r\n\r\nEvaluation of the model can be found here (in submission). \r\n[Evaluation_19_11_2025.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24216215/Evaluation_19_11_2025.docx)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full overview of WHAM! and the structure of its coupling is described in these three papers:\r\n\r\nModel description: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/17/3993/2024/\r\nPrototype coupling and calibration: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024EF004770\r\nFuture model runs: https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2025/egusphere-2025-3728/\r\n\r\nAn additional paper, detailing the online coupling is close to submission. \r\n\r\nAlthough this PR allows WHAM! to be coupled with JULES in a dynamic way, it is not a full tight coupling (yet). Rather, outputs from the WHAM! model are passed as ancillaries. These are then updated in line with the changing distribution of plant functional types in JULES. \r\n\r\nSci/Tech Reviewer: Eddy Robertson\r\nCode Reviewer: <!-- CR id, filled by SSD -->\r\n\r\n<!-- To be completed by the developer -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a brief description of the changes in this PR, including any notes\r\n     useful for reviewers -->\r\n\r\nThere are three fundamental changes made to the code. \r\n\r\n1. The first (ignitions) is toggled using a new ignitions mode\r\n2. The second (managed fire) is on a new switch \"l_inferno_wham\"\r\n3. The third (fire line intensity) is able to run with / without WHAM!. It is set using a new \"fire_mortality_method\" integer that maintains current functionality. \r\n\r\n1) Ignitions mode\r\n- A new ignitions mode is added (4). This specifies that ignitions, or unmanaged fires, are taken from WHAM! outputs. These are the sum of accidental anthropogenic fires, arson (fire use as a weapon under land use conflict) and escaped fires - managed fires that grow out of control.\r\n- Importantly, ignitions from WHAM! take account of the seasonality of human fire use: i.e. they vary monthly, rather than being uniform across the calendar year. \r\n- This also incorporates WHAM! projections of fire suppression (i.e. fire fighting). \r\n\r\n2) Managed fire\r\n- As much as 50% of global burned area is generated by small anthropogenic fires, typically used in livestock farming and for hunting/gathering in savanna ecosystems. \r\n- WHAM! adds these into the model. Setting l_inferno_wham to True switches this functionality on. \r\n- In addition, it also adds the use of road density to adjust mean fire size. This is a simple representation of fragmentation that should increase fire size & burned area in remote regions, whilst reducing it where there is widespread human activity. \r\n- Managed fire use varies month to month in line with WHAM!'s projection of fire use seasonality. (as with ignitions). \r\n- Human fire use for fire risk reduction (i.e. prescribed fire or cultural burning) changes dynamically with tree cover. See, it is lower in wet tropical forests than open savannas. This is updated dynamically based on the PFT distribution at each time step. \r\n\r\n3) Fire line intensity\r\nWork by Olivia Haas (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac6a69) has demonstrated that fire intensity (Watts emitted per m2 burned) has different drivers to burned area. \r\n\r\nFire intensity is closely related to vegetation mortality. Therefore, a new intensity algorithm was developed that captures the spatio-temporal variation in mortality. This replaces the current parameterisation of mortality as the product of burned area and a scalar value per PFT. \r\n\r\nA new variable \"fire_mortality_method\" is defined with three levels:\r\n1) The original mortality method (per Burton 2019)\r\n2) The Burton method adjusted for saturation moisture. This provides a boundary condition around tropical forests. Too much mortality in tropical forests has been an issue in INFERNO. \r\n3) The new fireline intensity algorithm. I have added a supplementary file that shows the relationships used in this. Important to note is that this can be run with / without WHAM. So, setting fire_mortality_method = 3 & l_inferno_wham = .false. will replace WHAM! inputs into the intensity algorithm with a function of population density. \r\n\r\n[SI1_Intensity_Algorithm_15122025.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24216049/SI1_Intensity_Algorithm_15122025.docx)\r\n\r\n<!-- List any linked PRs here\r\n- linked MetOffice/<REPO-NAME>#<pr-number>\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- List any blocking PRs or issues to be closed here\r\n- is blocked-by #pr-number\r\n- blocks #pr-number\r\n\r\n- closes #issue-number\r\n- fixes #issue-number\r\n- is related to #issue-number\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Checklist\r\n\r\n(_Some checks are automatically carried out via the CI pipeline_)\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [ ] My code follows the project's style guidelines\r\n- [ ] Comments have been included that aid undertanding and enhance the\r\n      readability of the code\r\n- [ ] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] If editing `rose-meta/jules-shared` then have you supplied a linked UM PR?\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have tested this change locally, using the JULES rose-stem suite\r\n- [ ] If shared files have been modified, I have run the UM and LFRic Apps rose\r\n      stem suites\r\n- [ ] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and\r\n      acceptable (eg. kgo changes)\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (eg. system\r\n      tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your trac.log from testing output here -->\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have reviewed my changes for potential security issues\r\n- [ ] Sensitive data is properly handled (if applicable)\r\n- [ ] Authentication and authorisation are properly implemented (if applicable)\r\n\r\n## Performance Impact\r\n\r\n- [ ] Performance of the code has been considered and, if applicable, suitable\r\n      performance measurements have been conducted\r\n\r\n## AI Assistance and Attribution\r\n\r\n- [ ] Some of the content of this change has been produced with the assistance\r\n      of _Generative AI tool name_ (e.g., Met Office Github Copilot Enterprise,\r\n      Github Copilot Personal, ChatGPT GPT-4, etc) and I have followed the\r\n      [Simulation Systems AI policy](https://metoffice.github.io/simulation-systems/FurtherDetails/ai.html)\r\n      (including attribution labels)\r\n\r\n<!-- If AI has been used, please provide more details here -->\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] Where appropriate I have updated documentation related to this change and\r\n      confirmed that it builds correctly\r\n\r\n## Approvals\r\n\r\nPlease request all relevant approvals.

#70.\r\n\r\nThe new plots are:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" alt=\"baroclinic_plot-theta-time864000 0-xy\"

Checklist\r\n\r\n(_Some checks are automatically carried out via the CI pipeline_)\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My code follows the project's style guidelines\r\n      [style guidelines](https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_core/how_to_contribute/index.html#how-to-contribute-index)\r\n- [x] Comments have been included that aid undertanding and enhance the\r\n      readability of the code\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested this change locally, using the LFRic Apps rose-stem suite\r\n- [x] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and\r\n      acceptable (eg. kgo changes)\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (eg. system\r\n      tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n- [x] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource\r\n      and have tests been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the\r\n      developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource\r\n      and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\n\r\n###

readability of the code\r\n- [X] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [X] I have tested this change locally, using the LFRic Core rose-stem suite\r\n- [X] If required (e.g. API changes) I have also run the LFRic Apps test suite\r\n      using this branch\r\n- [ ] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and\r\n      acceptable (e.g. kgo changes)\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (e.g. system\r\n      tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n- [ ] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource\r\n      and have been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the\r\n      developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource\r\n      and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n\r\n# Test Suite Results - lfric_core - timing_mod_core_updated/run1\r\n\r\n## Suite

When using a more standard configuration (e.g. um_dump) the runs fail, citing problems in `ukca_aero_ctl.F90`.\r\n\r\nAfter investigation in #73, the problem was that UKCA segment size was not passed to the initialisation of UKCA when using `dust_and_clim` settings. This is a small fix that mirrors the solution in `ukca_init()` in `um_ukca_init_mod.f90`.\r\n\r\nI also removed the `noukca` configuration from the small threaded tests (C48_MG, C192_MG) since these were only made to get around the problem fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\n> [!WARNING]\r\n> This means that the old KGOs must be removed and new ones added for these tests.\r\n\r\nI have tested C896_MG and tests >1 thread pass and do not require the `noukca` configuration. I tested with both GNU and CCE at fast-debug.\r\n\r\n<!-- List any linked PRs here\r\n- linked MetOffice/<REPO-NAME>#<pr-number>\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- List any blocking PRs or issues to be closed

This may be able to be done with XIOS in future, but right now this remains a feature gap.\r\n\r\nFor all other metadata specifications, these are implemented using XIOS, and removed from post processing.\r\n\r\nThis also removes the need for MPI `init_wait()` calls from most usage patterns.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a soft requirement for new XML configuration, forecast reference times

understanding and enhance the\r\n      readability of the code\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested this change locally, using the LFRic Core rose-stem suite\r\n- [x] If required (e.g. API changes) I have also run the LFRic Apps test suite\r\n      using this branch\r\n- [x] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and\r\n      acceptable (e.g. kgo changes)\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (e.g. system\r\n      tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n- [x] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource\r\n      and have been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the\r\n      developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource\r\n      and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n\r\n# Test Suite Results - lfric_core -

Here, I'm taking this opportunity to remove 3 of these switches (l_lambdam2, l_full_lambdas and var_diags_opt).   This then also permits a more logical reorganisation of the code in ex_coef that should make it easier to read and also to modify further in the future.  Scientifically there are no changes at all and the KGO are preserved.\r\nNote that I did also try removing a 4th hardwired switch, l_use_var_fixes, but so-doing broke KGO (for just the \r\ncoupled_nwp_gal9_64bit app, presumably due to some interaction with the compiler optimisation in the subroutine excf_nl.F90) so I've have reverted that change in the latest revision.  Subject to discussion with reviewers.\r\n\r\nUpdate 21/01/2026: following discussions with the Sci-tech reviewer, I've now removed the redundant variable h_blend_orog all through the LFRic code tree (it was being passed from JULES but always containing zeros as the effective orographic roughness scheme is not available in LFRic, and has been superseded by the distributed version in all configurations).  All developer tests still maintain kgo, see updated trac.log below.\r\n\r\n<!-- List any linked PRs here\r\n- none\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- List any blocking PRs or issues to be closed here\r\n- is blocked-by #pr-number\r\n- blocks #pr-number\r\n- closes #91 (auto-closes the issue)\r\n- fixes #91 (auto-closes the issue)\r\n- is related to #issue-number\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Checklist\r\n\r\n(_Some checks are automatically carried out via the CI pipeline_)\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My code follows the project's style guidelines\r\n      [style guidelines](https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_core/how_to_contribute/index.html#how-to-contribute-index)\r\n- [x] Comments have been included that aid undertanding and enhance the\r\n      readability of the code\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested this change locally, using the LFRic Apps rose-stem suite\r\n- [x] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and\r\n      acceptable (eg. kgo changes): no changes to kgo\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (eg. system\r\n      tests, unit tests, etc.): no new functionality added\r\n- [x] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource\r\n      and have tests been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the\r\n      developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource\r\n      and complete in a matter of minutes): no new tests added or needed\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n\r\n# Test Suite Results - lfric_apps - ex_coef_tidy/run4\r\n\r\n## Suite Information\r\n\r\n| Item | Value |\r\n| :--- | :--- |\r\n| Suite Name | [ex_coef_tidy/run4](https://cylchub/services/cylc-review/cycles/adrian.lock/?suite=ex_coef_tidy%2Frun4) |\r\n| Suite User | adrian.lock |\r\n| Workflow Start | 2026-01-22T21:07:25 |\r\n| Groups Run | developer |\r\n\r\n| Dependency | Reference | Main Like |\r\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\r\n| casim | [MetOffice/casim@2025.12.1](https://github.com/MetOffice/casim/tree/2025.12.1) | True |\r\n| jules | [MetOffice/jules@2025.12.1](https://github.com/MetOffice/jules/tree/2025.12.1) | True |\r\n| lfric_apps | [Adrian-Lock/lfric_apps@ex_coef_tidy](https://github.com/Adrian-Lock/lfric_apps/tree/ex_coef_tidy) | False |\r\n| lfric_core | [MetOffice/lfric_core@5d4d72f](https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_core/tree/5d4d72f) | True |\r\n| moci | [MetOffice/moci@2025.12.1](https://github.com/MetOffice/moci/tree/2025.12.1) | True |\r\n| SimSys_Scripts | [MetOffice/SimSys_Scripts@2025.12.1](https://github.com/MetOffice/SimSys_Scripts/tree/2025.12.1) | True |\r\n| socrates | [MetOffice/socrates@2025.12.1](https://github.com/MetOffice/socrates/tree/2025.12.1) | True |\r\n| socrates-spectral | [MetOffice/socrates-spectral@2025.12.1](https://github.com/MetOffice/socrates-spectral/tree/2025.12.1) | True |\r\n| ukca | [MetOffice/ukca@2025.12.1](https://github.com/MetOffice/ukca/tree/2025.12.1) | True |\r\n\r\n## Task Information\r\n:white_check_mark: succeeded tasks - 1106\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations\r\n\r\n- [x] I have reviewed my changes for potential security issues\r\n- [x] Sensitive data is properly handled (if applicable)\r\n- [x] Authentication and authorisation are properly implemented (if applicable)\r\n\r\n## Performance Impact\r\n\r\n- [x] Performance of the code has been considered and, if applicable, suitable\r\n      performance measurements have been conducted\r\n\r\n## AI Assistance and Attribution\r\n\r\n- [x] None of the content of this change has been produced with the assistance\r\n      of _Generative AI tool name_ (e.g., Met Office Github Copilot Enterprise,\r\n      Github Copilot Personal, ChatGPT GPT-4, etc) and I have followed the\r\n      [Simulation Systems AI policy](https://metoffice.github.io/simulation-systems/FurtherDetails/ai.html)\r\n      (including attribution labels)\r\n\r\n<!-- If AI has been used, please provide more details here -->\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] Where appropriate I have updated documentation related to this change and\r\n      confirmed that it builds correctly: no changes needed\r\n\r\n## PSyclone Approval\r\n\r\n- [x] If you have edited any psyclone related code (eg.

The fix, however, does not set the frequency within LFRic for these files which could result in unexpected behaviour down the line. More details on the issue can be found in #171.\r\nThis change adds some code which can fetch the frequency of the file from the iodef.xml where possible.  The code will:\r\n1. look for a frequency definition within the LFRic fortran code\r\n2. if there is none, it will take the frequency from the iodef.xml.\r\n3. If there is no frequency definition in the iodef.xml the model will fail in an XIOS call.\r\n\r\nThere are also some new tests which exercise the behaviour where the frequency is not set within the model. There are also a few QoL improvements to the `.gitignore` and some general updates to the testing framework to enable the new tests.\r\n\r\n<!-- List any linked PRs here-->\r\n- closes

This includes both the canned test and the rose-stem tests.\r\n\r\n`linear_model` uses multigrid preconditioning in the solver, and taking advantage of this in the adjoint requires a minor code change in `science/adjoint/source/algorithm/solver/adj_semi_implicit_solver_alg_mod.x90`, and to test this, minor code changes in some of the test algorithms in `applications/adjoint_tests/source/algorithm/solver/`\r\n\r\n`linear_model` also reads linearisation states from file, whereas `adjoint_tests` currently sets them up analytically. Moving to reading from file requires some minor changes e.g., to iodef files, but also allows the removal of a lot of the analytical linearisation state setup code in some of the test algorithms.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the alignment of `adjoint_tests` with `linear_model` simple, any necessary deviations are handled by optional configurations, so that the base configurations (`rose-app.conf` files) always remain identical.\r\n\r\nThis work has highlighted a minor bug which can also be dealt with by way of an optional configuration. I have opened #87 for this. Once it is dealt with the optional configuration will simply need to be removed.\r\n\r\nFor now, adding C224 tests to `adjoint_tests`, to match those in `linear_model`, is not being done, due to ongoing issues with running `adjoint_tests` in parallel (see https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/lfric_apps/ticket/800).\r\n\r\n~~Finally, the code/patch changes from #71 (`science/adjoint/source/kernel/transport/mol/atl_poly1d_vert_w3_reconstruction_kernel_mod.F90` and `science/adjoint/patches/kernel/atl_poly1d_vert_adv_kernel_mod.patch`) are required for one of the configuration changes, _so they've been duplicated here but need not be reviewed again._ This makes #71 a blocker.~~ _Done!_\r\n\r\nAlso please note I branched from `main` rather than `stable` by mistake - apologies for this. I can make a new branch/PR if desired.\r\n\r\n- closes #84\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My code follows the project's [style

brief description of the changes in this PR, including any notes\r\n     useful for reviewers -->\r\nThis pull request enables sea-ice ancillaries to be read on categories. This is required for surf ancillaries in coupled NWP where we require information about sea-ice at lake points that are not resolved by NEMO. The new functionality is only used for surf ancils at the moment. Adding it for other types of sea-ice ancils would just require a change to xml files but there is no requirement for this at the moment.\r\n\r\nTo enable the change, I have also had to make some changes to the logic of reading SST and sea-ice ancils. In particular, coupled climate model runs will now need the seaice_source variable set to \"start_dump\" instead of \"ancil\" as was used previously. This has no effect on results. I can't see a way to implement an upgrade macro for this change as the required value is different for coupled vs atmosphere only models. Given my team is likely to be the only one upgrading coupled workflows from vn3.0 to vn3.1 I think we will be able to deal with this manually.\r\n\r\nThe axes of one input file used by two tests have been updated as part of this change.\r\n\r\n<!-- List any linked PRs here\r\n- linked MetOffice/<REPO-NAME>#<pr-number>\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- List any blocking PRs or issues to be closed here\r\n- is blocked-by #pr-number\r\n- blocks #pr-number\r\n- closes #issue-number (auto-closes the issue)\r\n- fixes #118  (auto-closes the issue)\r\n- is related to #118 \r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My code follows the project's [style guidelines](https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_core/how_to_contribute/index.html#how-to-contribute-index)\r\n- [x] Comments have been included that aid understanding and enhance the readability of the code\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] All automated checks in the CI pipeline have completed successfully\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested this change locally, using the LFRic Core rose-stem suite\r\n- [ ] If required (e.g. API changes) I have also run the LFRic Apps test suite using this branch\r\n- [x] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and acceptable (e.g. kgo changes)\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (e.g. system tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n- [ ] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource and have been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\nThis has been tested in NWP case study workflows at multiple LFRic versions. It has also been tested in AMIP and coupled climate workflows to ensure that it doesn't change results.\r\nThe metadata validation task fails at the moment because I have edited metadata at HEAD but the coupled task still points to vn3.0 metadata. \r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n# Test Suite Results - lfric_apps - git_ostia_ancils/run1\r\n\r\n## Suite Information\r\n\r\n| Item | Value |\r\n| :--- | :---

The branch was created from #132's branch in my fork, but I can't make a PR into that branch because then I would be stuck in my fork. So, to look at the actual changes relevant to this PR alone, look at the diff of this branch with #132's branch: https://github.com/tom-j-h/lfric_apps/compare/jelf_adjoint_test_tolerance_nml...tom-j-h:lfric_apps:align_jedi_lfric_tests_to_linear_model\r\n\r\nSimilar to #84, but for applications of `jedi_lfric_tests` that use the linear and adjoint models.\r\n\r\nThis change relies on the same small code change in science/adjoint as #84. It is also very useful to be able to set adjoint test tolerance via a namelist variable () for running the strict vs. relaxed adjoint tests, hence the order of branching.\r\n\r\nA bug (incorrect adjoint) relating to the incremental wind interpolation added in https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/lfric_apps/ticket/369 has arisen due to the changes here.

This reenables this functionality by fetching/pulling changes if the build is being rerun. This has been tested on the command line for both a run with physics code (lfric_atm) and without (gungho_model). The 2nd build time is much quicker as expected.\r\n\r\nThis also enables building using the local github mirrors which will be useful once these are also available on the HPC. Again, these have been tested on the cli and with incremental builds.\r\n\r\nThis change adds `get_git_sources` which is mostly a copy of the same file from SimSys_Scripts. Having 2 copies isn't ideal, but I can't think of another way to make that SimSys_Scripts file available when building locally (short of installing it as a library). Hopefully this is something that'll be improved by fab! \r\n\r\n<!-- List any linked PRs here\r\n- linked MetOffice/<REPO-NAME>#<pr-number>\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- List any blocking PRs or issues to be closed here\r\n- is blocked-by #pr-number\r\n- blocks #pr-number\r\n- closes #issue-number (auto-closes the issue)\r\n- fixes #issue-number (auto-closes the issue)\r\n- is related to #issue-number\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My code follows the project's [style guidelines](https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_core/how_to_contribute/index.html#how-to-contribute-index)\r\n- [x] Comments have been included that aid understanding and enhance the readability of the code\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [x] All automated checks in the CI pipeline have completed successfully\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested this change locally, using the LFRic Core rose-stem suite\r\n- [x] If required (e.g. API changes) I have also run the LFRic Apps test suite using this branch\r\n- [ ] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and acceptable (e.g. kgo changes)\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (e.g. system tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n- [x] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource and have been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n\r\n# Test Suite Results -

nwp_gal9 configuration in the linear integration tests (to match the default configuration for the linear_model). This includes using data read from file to initialise the tests.\r\n* Update the integration tests linear drivers to match the linear model driver (this required a safety switch added to gungho_step)\r\n* Reduce the number of tests for the semi-implicit and runge-kutta configs (as nwp_gal9 is running most tests)\r\n* Update the plot_convergence.sh script (this is not part of the test suite but is useful to have) - this runs the integration tests multiple times and creates plots of the data.\r\n* Improve how the convergence rate in the integration tests is tested.\r\n\r\n<!-- List any linked PRs here\r\n- linked MetOffice/<REPO-NAME>#<pr-number>\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- List any blocking PRs or issues to be closed here\r\n- is blocked-by #pr-number\r\n- blocks #pr-number\r\n- closes #issue-number (auto-closes the issue)\r\n- fixes #issue-number (auto-closes the issue)\r\n- is related to #issue-number\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My code follows the project's [style guidelines](https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_core/how_to_contribute/index.html#how-to-contribute-index)\r\n- [x] Comments have been included that aid understanding and enhance the readability of the code\r\n- [x] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [x] All automated checks in the CI pipeline have completed successfully\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested this change locally, using the LFRic Core rose-stem suite\r\n- [x] If required (e.g. API changes) I have also run the LFRic Apps test suite using this branch\r\n- [ ] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and acceptable (e.g. kgo changes)\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (e.g. system tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n- [x] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource and have been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\n\r\n### Plot convergence results\r\nhttps://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_apps/issues/115#issuecomment-3785320045\r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your trac.log from testing output here -->\r\n# Test Suite Results -

The change in this PR is:\r\n- make `get_required_stencil_depth` a subroutine, returning the value for a particular mesh\r\n- removing `get_required_stencil_depth` and replacing it with `mesh%get_halo_depth()` in appropriate science code\r\n- picking up the change in API to the LFRic-Core `init_mesh` routine, so that `stencil_depth` is a rank-1 array (with different values passed for different meshes)\r\n\r\nThis changes the KGO of the Schar mountain test. This is because this test has a width in the y-direction of 8 cells, but uses a maximum halo depth of 4 -- meaning that the furthest cell in both positive and negative directions is the same. This triggers issue #175.

The coordinate fields can be in a Wtheta space (discontinuous in the horizontal, continuous in the vertical)\r\n2. The coordinate space used by multigrid meshes is not tied to the coordinate space used by the prime mesh\r\n\r\nWhen `Wtheta` is used as the function space, the vertical coordinate order is kept as 0, making the coordinates linear in the vertical. These options are an optimisation to the coordinate fields, which will facilitate us moving to `coord_order=2` which gives a significant boost in NWP score:\r\n1. using a `Wtheta` space allows us to have fewer DoFs per cell (see below)\r\n2. keeping a lower coordinate order for multigrid meshes has minimal scientific impact but is a small optimisation, and avoids the bug reported in #239

principle performance improvement in this pull request is to split the application of the mixed operator into two seperate new kernels. \r\n\r\n1.  science/gungho/source/kernel/solver/apply_mixed_u_operator_kernel_mod.F90 computes the lhs for the horizontal wind components. This is done in the broken W2h space so that a write access can be used, avoiding any colouring or halo swaps. After this call the broken W2h lhs needs to be assembled in the  continuous W2h space (reapplying  a single halo swap)\r\n2. science/gungho/source/kernel/solver/apply_mixed_wp_operator_kernel_mod.F90 computes the lhs for the vertical wind and pressure components. As these fields lie on horizontally discontinuous spaces there is no colouring or halo exchanges needed.\r\n\r\nThese changes result in a performance improvement for 2 main reasons\r\n1. Better use of memory by splitting the single large kernel into two kernels and (presumably) getting better cache usage\r\n2. Reduction in the number of halo swaps from 3 (for the horizontal wind, vertical wind & pressure) into 1 (for the broken horizontal wind lhs). It appears one of these saved halo exchanges is then reinstated elsewhere in the code, likely when the pressure lhs or vertical wind lhs is needed in the halo region in a seperate kernel.\r\n\r\nThe C224 & C896 lfric atm tests in the test suite were run with these changes giving the following solver times\r\n\r\n| Code | C224 | C896 |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| Trunk | 50.71 | 114.57 |\r\n| Branch | 41.59 | 98.69 |\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- List any linked PRs here\r\n- linked MetOffice/<REPO-NAME>#<pr-number>\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- List any blocking PRs or issues to be closed here\r\n- is blocked-by #pr-number\r\n- blocks #pr-number\r\n- closes #issue-number (auto-closes the issue)\r\n- fixes #issue-number (auto-closes the issue)\r\n- is related to #issue-number\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [X] My code follows the project's [style guidelines](https://metoffice.github.io/lfric_core/how_to_contribute/index.html#how-to-contribute-index)\r\n- [X] Comments have been included that aid understanding and enhance the readability of the code\r\n- [X] My changes generate no new warnings\r\n- [ ] All automated checks in the CI pipeline have completed successfully\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have tested this change locally, using the LFRic Core rose-stem suite\r\n- [X] If required (e.g. API changes) I have also run the LFRic Apps test suite using this branch\r\n- [X] If any tests fail (rose-stem or CI) the reason is understood and acceptable (e.g. kgo changes)\r\n- [X] I have added tests to cover new functionality as appropriate (e.g. system tests, unit tests, etc.)\r\n- [X] Any new tests have been assigned an appropriate amount of compute resource and have been allocated to an appropriate testing group (i.e. the developer tests are for jobs which use a small amount of compute resource and complete in a matter of minutes)\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe other testing performed (if applicable) -->\r\n\r\n### trac.log\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your trac.log from testing output here -->\r\n\r\nThese results are from before the KGO update.

This allows the heights of cell centres to be match the values defined in the orography ancillary files, and avoids loss of power in the orography from the process of averaging from W3 to W0 points. This has shown a significant improvement in NWP scores.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR can be summarised as:\r\n1. Ensure that the `surface_altitude` field has a degree that is specified through a new namelist option (and is not inherited from `element_order`)\r\n2. Reorganise `orography` namelist, to make this more coherent by:\r\n- moving `n_orog_smooth` into the `orography` namelist from `initialization`\r\n- moving `w0_orography_mapping` into the `orography` namelist and renaming it as `w0_multigrid_mapping`\r\n- introducing the `orography_order` option\r\n3. Set `coord_order=2` and `orography_order=2` as default for the gungho_model, lfric_atm, linear_model and jedi_lfric_tests apps (which updates KGOs)\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\nThe use of quadratic coordinate order has shown considerable improvement in NWP scores. For results, see:\r\n- [Winter DA trials](https://wwwspice/~martin.willett/verification/GC6B2_quadorog_JFM25_C224/imt/page.html?DDV)\r\n- [Standard NWP case studies](https://wwwspice/~thomas.bendall/GES/GC5-LFRic_dv665/imt/page.html?DDV)\r\n- [C64 AMIP](https://wwwspice/~thomas.bendall/autoassess/u-dv532_vs_u-ds757/valnote/means_global.html)\r\n\r\n**Important Links**:\r\nThis branch is built on top of two other PRs.

So, to look at the actual changes relevant to this PR alone, look at the diff of this branch with #161's branch: https://github.com/tom-j-h/lfric_apps/compare/jelf_C224_adjoint_tests...tom-j-h:lfric_apps:tlad_boundary_layer\r\n\r\n**PLEASE ALSO NOTE** - #163 is blocked by #161 which is blocked by #156 which relies on https://github.com/MetOffice/lfric_core/pull/227, so when testing, I used this Core branch.\r\n\r\nThe change includes new files to be added to BIG_DATA_DIR -

mode from column to domain in radaer_kernal_mod.F90 so that Psyclone can recognise the update, automatically generate the radaer_alg_mod_psy.f90 file, and provide suitable arguments for all subroutines. This enables the full horizontal and vertical domain data transfer to the RADAER code.\r\n\r\nUpdate variable dimensions: Adjust variable sizes in radaer_kernal_mod.F90 to accept whole-domain data. A do loop was then introduced to initialise variables passed into key RADAER subroutines and to store the computed results, that involved a change of the data structure extents and associated loops from an \"I-first\" to a \"K-first\" approach.\r\n\r\n**Bug fix**\r\n\r\nBoth the p_theta_levels and t_theta_levels pass the wrong number of dimensions to ukca_radaer_prepare.\r\n\r\n**Rafactor radaer kernel**\r\n\r\nIn order to limit the number of times we switch from I-first to K-first addressing, I have made a UKCA side interface module that calls all of the UKCA side science code. I also reordered the sequence of I-first to K-first addressing.\r\n\r\n**Segmentation**\r\n\r\nAll of the arrays passed to the UKCA side are now allocatable, so that correct segments can be passed with each iteration of the segmentation loop. The order of deallocation is the reverse order of allocation to prevent memory striding.\r\n\r\nThe I-first to K-first addressing changes from [#841](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/lfric_apps/ticket/841) full domain have been refactored so that the memory points to the part of memory associated with the segment for each iteration of the segment loop. This was complicated and is difficulty to describe in words, but I think will make sense when looking at the code change.\r\n\r\nFor short wave only, radaer_band_average does not need to be called for nightside segments, and this is a considerable cost save. We determine if any of the columns within each segment are on the dayside or not and pass that information to the UKCA interface code. This logical is calculated inside the segmentation loop.\r\n\r\nSimilirly, as the AOD diagnostics are optional, we only have to call the diagnostic modules if they are requested. I gather this information outside the segmentation loop.\r\n\r\n- linked MetOffice/UKCA#21\r\n\r\n<!-- List any blocking PRs or issues to be closed here\r\n- is blocked-by #pr-number\r\n- blocks

`rhcrit` field is an evolving field that is an input to glomap aerosol. Currently, it is not written to the checkpoint restart file resulting in some runs losing bit comparison across a checkpoint-restart point relative to an equivalent longer run. This failure ought to have been picked up by the nrun-crun tests, but the existing tests run only one-timestep continuation runs, and the main prognostics written to the checksum file are unaffected till the second timestep.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible solutions: first, `rhcrit` could be written to and read from the checkpoint file. Second, the value of `rhcrit` can be taken from the configuration file rather than from the field. According to @iboutle, this is what is done in the UM. Therefore, this solution takes the second approach.\r\n\r\nThe PR includes expected KGO changes.\r\n\r\nPSyclone now includes the capability to pass arrays to kernels, but lfric_apps does not yet use a version of PSyclone with this functionality.

There are no tests of uneven partitions. The single panel partitioner unit tests use an 8x8 full domain mesh. If this is partitioned over 3 ranks, it should result in partitions of size 3x8, 3x8 and 2x8 (i.e. uneven). Add such tests to the biperiodic,  planar and x- plus y- trench mesh partitioner tests.\r\n2. There is no test of the parallel cubedsphere partitioner. This was omitted because it is slow to run from the command line. Whilst that is true (it is slower than all the other infrastructure unit tests combined), this is the partitioner used for almost all global model runs - so I have added it in (and we'll take the hit on runtime).\r\n3. The current test suite runs the unit tests on one core - even though the infrastructure unit tests are parallel. The infrastructure unit tests take two and a half minutes to complete. Giving them the correct number of cores to run on drops this to 8 seconds. There is no fine-grained control of resources for the unit tests, so after discussions with SSD, we decided it was fine for all \"technical tests\" (integration- and unit-tests) to run on multiple cores. The Met Office appears to have its own overrides for this setting, but I have also changed the system default (as I can see no reason for anyone wanting to run a parallel test on a single core)\r\n\r\n## Code Quality Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] My code follows the project's [style

I've also removed the hardcoded list of repositories from workload.py, instead now including columns in the SSD table for all repos that have PRs in the project so that everything is included. This is lots at the moment as we had some wide-reaching workflow updates, but hopefully in the future this will actually reduce the size of the table to not include empty columns. \r\n\r\nI've also updated the repository list in the manage milestones list to be more complete and fixed a bug with \"'s. \r\n\r\n<!-- List any linked PRs here\r\n- linked
