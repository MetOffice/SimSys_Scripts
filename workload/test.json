It works out the extension by looking for either the flow.cylc or suite.rc in the top level rose-stem directory.\r\nUnfortunately the UM was updated to use a flow.cylc, but didn't rename all the files. So it needs .rc extension but has a flow.cylc and so this script has broken. \r\nFix temporarily by looking for family-common.rc instead of suite.rc. By vn14.0 it will use all .cylc extensions, so all this logic can be removed.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes\r\n",
